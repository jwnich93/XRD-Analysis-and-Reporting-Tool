# XRD-Analysis-and-Reporting-Tool

See the Wiki for ongoing updates and documentation as this tool evolves.

Project Mission: 

Provide researchers of x ray diffraction a set of tools in the Python and Jupyter Lab ecosystem, to enable reproducible transparent high quality research and 360 degree visibility on the data.  

Build models that allow for speed and agility for the researcher to analyze the data.

Produce publication quality graphics that are scalabe, repeatable, and dynamic.

1 Github repository to host a research project:

a. Data Gathering at Laboratory

b. Data Munging

c. Query and Reporting

d. Insights and Findings

e. Publication quality tables, graphs, etc.
